Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. 
The dataset contains various features of passengers such as age, sex, class, ticket fare, etc. The main goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a passenger survived or not based on these features.

Description: T he sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large number of passengers and crew. The dataset provided, "train.csv", contains information about a subset of the passengers on board, including whether they survived or not.
Columns.

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger. Survived: This column indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0). Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd). Name: Name of the passenger. Sex: Gender of the passenger. Age: Age of the passenger in years. SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic. Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic. Ticket: Ticket number. Fare: Passenger fare. Cabin: Cabin number. Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

Model Building: To predict the survival of passengers, a Random Forest Classifier model is used. Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.

The following steps are involved in building the model:

Data Preprocessing: This involves handling missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical format (if required), and scaling features. Feature Selection/Engineering: Identifying important features that contribute most to the prediction and creating new features if needed. Model Training: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and training the Random Forest Classifier on the training data. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance. Prediction: Finally, using the trained model to make predictions on unseen data.

Conclusion: This project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in predicting survival outcomes based on Titanic passenger data. By analyzing various features and utilizing a Random Forest Classifier, we aim to create a reliable predictive model that can assist in understanding the factors that influenced survival during this historic event.
